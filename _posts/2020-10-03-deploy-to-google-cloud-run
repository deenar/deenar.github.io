## Checklist
- Google Cloud Account
- Google Cloud CLI
- Dockerized Application

##Step 1 - Create a GCP Service Account
- Create a service account under IAM
- Grant it the following roles
- Download the credentials

##Step 2 - Push your Docker image to [GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)
Customise your Docker image publishing in build.sbt
```
dockerBaseImage := "java:8-jre"
packageName in Docker := "<you-gcloud-project-id>/api"
maintainer in Docker := "Maintainer"
packageSummary := "Package summary"
packageDescription := "Package description"
dockerRepository := Some("us.gcr.io")
```
- Substitute your Google Cloud Project ID in the packageName field
- Set dockerRepository to whichever gcr.io host you want to use.
- Authenticate using the Google Cloud SDK using the service account credentials used in Step 1
- Run sbt docker:publish

## Step 3 - Create a Google Cloud Run service
[Head to Google Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run) and create a new service
	- Select a region
    - Pick a service name
    - Select unauthenticated invocations
    - Choose the container image you uploaded to GCR in Step 2
    - Ask GCP to forward traffic to the port your application listens on and set any environment variables required
    - Choose the service account created in Step 1 to run the application
    - Under advanced setting choose memory and CPU allocation and auto scaling parameters
    - Press Create
    
## Step 3 - Check your application    
    - GCP deploys your application and makes it available on the URL listed
    - Check you application 
    - Look at logs for troubleshooting
    

## Step 4 - Automate the boring stuff so you can focus on the important bits    
    - I am using bitbucket as the repository, here is my /bitbucket-pipelines.yml. I have added a pipeline to deploy to GCP. It listens to changes on tag master release-gcp-* and kicks of the process we did manually before. I store the service credentials in bitbuckets environment variables, which are encrypted and stored in a vault.
